# odin-landing-page
this is a simple landing page for a website 
i used html and css exclusively to build the web 
page with several clickable buttons and links and 4 distinct 
sub-sections dividing the page up, not including the header/footer 
css flexbox was my primary mode of organizing/aligning the content properly
